# Basic Python Project

This project was developed as part of the Data Analysis course at TripleTen. The goal was to practice core programming concepts in Python by solving step-by-step tasks.

## What was practiced

- Data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `list`)
- String manipulation (uppercase, lowercase, replacement, trimming)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Error handling using `try-except`
- Code organization and explanatory comments

## Project goal

To reinforce the fundamentals of Python through small guided challenges, simulating real programming scenarios such as data validation and list manipulation.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file
2. Open it using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with the Jupyter extension

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment

## Notebook structure

Each task includes:
- A clear explanation of the challenge
- Functional code with comments
- Output tests and behavior validation

This is my first Python project. Feedback is very welcome!
